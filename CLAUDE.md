# CLAUDE.md

High-level guidance for AI assistants and humans working in this repo.

## Read First

Before non-trivial changes:
1. This file (you're here)
2. `README.md`
3. The module-level CLAUDE.md for whichever subsystem you're touching:
   - `src/metadata/CLAUDE.md` — link resolution + Deezer metadata
   - `src/soulseek/CLAUDE.md` — slskd peer search, scoring, downloads
   - `src/library/CLAUDE.md` — file/tag helpers (path sanitisation, FLAC/M4A taggers)
4. `.claude/rules/*.md` — deployment, tagging, downloads invariants
5. `docs/ROADMAP.md` — explicit "not now, maybe later" list

## What this is

Telegram bot that ingests music links from supported platforms (Tidal, Spotify, Apple Music, Deezer, YouTube Music, SoundCloud, Shazam, etc.), resolves them to canonical album/track metadata via **Deezer's open API**, downloads the audio from **Soulseek peers via slskd**, tags files with the canonical metadata, and drops them into a local Navidrome library.

## Architecture

```
Telegram message
  ↓
src/bot.py            — URL detection, authorization (ALLOWED_USERS), dispatch
  ↓
src/metadata/         — link resolver + Deezer fetcher (no auth, no token)
  resolver.py           Tidal/Spotify/Apple URL → platform-direct or Odesli → Deezer ID
  deezer.py             api.deezer.com → album/track JSON
  api.py                exposed as `metadata.fetch_album / fetch_lyrics / search / ...`
  ↓
src/soulseek/         — audio downloader via slskd-api
  client.py             search, parse, enqueue, monitor (asyncio.to_thread for sync slskd-api)
  scorer.py             100-pt scoring (coverage 50, quality 10 flat, reliability 25, filename 15)
  matcher.py            album-folder-first, per-track fallback
  downloader.py         orchestrator with retry across candidate peers
  ↓
src/library/          — file + tag helpers (format-agnostic)
  files.py              path sanitisation, _ensure_album_dir (case-insensitive resolve), _cover_url
  tagger.py             FLAC + M4A tag writers; force-mode wipes peer tags + writes Deezer canonical
  ↓
src/navidrome.py      — triggers Subsonic-style scan after writes
```

## Sibling containers

- `slskd` — Soulseek daemon (compose service, image `slskd/slskd:latest`)
  - Web UI on `127.0.0.1:5030` (host-loopback only, no auth — internal network)
  - Soulseek peer port `0.0.0.0:50300`
  - Shares `/media/music` read-only; downloads to `/media/music/.slskd-downloads/`
- `navidrome`, `samba` — separate stacks under `/opt/stacks/`

## Engineering rules

- Small, reviewable diffs.
- User-facing behavior stable unless changing it intentionally.
- Configuration & creds via `.env` only — never hardcode.
- No AI co-author trailers on commits unless explicitly requested.
- Casual commit messages (not conventional-commits style).
- Don't push without explicit user confirmation.

## Things you'll trip on

- **Quality cap**: `MAX_BIT_DEPTH` and `MAX_SAMPLE_RATE_HZ` env vars filter Soulseek peers above the cap. Defaults `24` / `96000` cover all reasonable hi-res; `16` / `44100` for redbook-only deployments.
- **slskd quirks** (handled in `soulseek/client.py`): completed searches must be deleted before new ones to avoid silent empty `responses` arrays; explicit `stop()` is required to transition InProgress→Complete and expose responses.
- **Proxy support**: every aiohttp session uses `trust_env=True` so it respects `HTTP_PROXY` / `HTTPS_PROXY` / `NO_PROXY` env vars (aiohttp's default is `False` — env vars get ignored without it). If a deployment's proxy gets throttled by a specific upstream (Odesli, Deezer CDN, lrclib), add that host to `NO_PROXY` so those requests go direct.
- **Tag normalisation**: in force-mode the FLAC / M4A / mp3 taggers wipe all existing tags before writing. They preserve a small allow-list (`composer`, `lyricist`, `performer`, peer's `comment` appended after our identifier).
- **Cover art**: stored in album dict as `cover_uuid` (historical field name) — actually holds the full Deezer CDN URL. `library.files._cover_url` and `metadata.client.cover_url` resize it for thumbnails / full-size art.

## How to deploy

- `./deploy-test.sh` — hot-reload `src/*.py` via `docker cp` + restart container. Detects local-server vs SSH mode automatically. **Does NOT** rebuild image, so changes to `requirements.txt` or `Dockerfile` need `docker compose up -d --build`.
- After `docker compose up -d music-bot` (recreate), the running container is a fresh image — any prior `docker cp` hot-reloads are lost; resync `src/` files manually or rebuild.

## Next steps deferred

See `docs/ROADMAP.md`. Notable items not yet done: MusicBrainz MBID enrichment, peer-side reputation memory, mp3-fallback prompt, inline-picker for borderline-confidence album-folder matches.
